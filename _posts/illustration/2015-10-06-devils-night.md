title: Devil's Night
meta: The illustration was created for an assignment to resemble the style of Josh Agle’s work. For this illustration, I chose the "Devil's Night“ theme and title, where the foreplay leads to a sensual night full of dark secrets. I then chose the analogous colour scheme of red, orange, yellow, and green. In the imagery, I created a scene where the focal point is the woman dressed in a tight-fitting devil outfit. Her body language is casual as her expression hides her dark secret. Across from her is a black cat sitting lazily on a yellow rug. The proud man in front of the window is waiting for her to make a move. In the room, I added a couch in 3D, a rug with a fur pattern, a brick-patterned wall, and a large window that overlooks a city at night. The underlying distressed orange background is created in Photoshop and then imported into Illustrator. Once there, the background underwent Live Trace to convert the raster image to a vector. I mostly worked with the pen tool to create the illustration over the pencil outline.
