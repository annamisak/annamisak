title: Devil's Night
meta: A Shag style illustration “The Devil’s Night“ where the foreplay leads to a sensual night full of dark secrets.
info: The illustration was created for an assignment to resemble the same style as Josh Agle’s work. For this illustration I had chosen the “The Devil’s Night“ theme and title where the foreplay leads to a sensual night full of dark secrets. I then chose the analogous colour scheme of red, orange, yellow and green. In the imagery I created a scene where the focal point is the woman dressed in a tight fitting devil outfit. Her body language casual as her expression hides her dark secret. Across from her a black cat sitting lazily on a yellow hue rug. The proud man in front of the window is waiting for her to make a move. In the room I added a couch in 3D, a rug with fur pattern, a brick patterned wall and a large window that over look a city at night. The underlying distressed orange background is created in Photoshop then imported in to Illustrator. Once there, the background under went Live Trace to convert the raster image to vector. I mostly worked with the pen tool to create the illustration over the pencil outline.
