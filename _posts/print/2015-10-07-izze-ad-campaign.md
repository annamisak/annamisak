title: IZZE Ad Campaign
meta: Rebranding ad campaign of IZZE's natural sparkling drinks.
info: Rebranding IZZE's line of natural sparkling beverages. Ads from IZZE are easily recognizable due to their straightforward concept and design. To tie the natural flavour with the overall message, real fruit and IZZE's sparkling fruit juice bottles are a common feature of the design.
info2: In my concept, the imagery creates the illusion of IZZE's chosen flavour bottle splattering into delicious fruit juice. In order to promote the brand, I chose the flavours watermelon, apple, and peach for my design instead of the traditional white background. In order to highlight the advantages of the IZZE all-natural beverage and to establish a visually appealing link between the product and the fruit, I focused on the fruit in each element surrounding the bottle in my design.
info3: In addition, I included two characters—a male and a female—who, after consuming IZZE's fruit beverage, exhibit intense excitement. This feeling is determined by how well the beverage makes a person feel without giving them the sugar rush that most drinks do. Numerous bubbles of various sizes were added around the image to highlight the juice's sparkling flavour. Except in the case of the peach flavour, where I chose to go with a contrasting colour of green to make the fruit pop, the background uses the colour of the selected fruit.
