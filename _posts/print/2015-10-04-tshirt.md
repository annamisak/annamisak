title: Steam Whistle T-shirt
meta: A t-Shirt design that was conceptualized for the Whistle Brewing who has been making beer—a Premium Pilsner that Canadians can be proud of.
info: Not only Steam Whistle Brewing has been making beer—a Premium Pilsner that Canadians can be proud of, but also focus on keeping our environment clean and our body GMO-free.
info2: These days, more and more people are becoming aware of what they are putting in their body and how their surroundings are being kept. Personally, I felt that Canadians should be more conscious about the Steam Whistle’s contribution to all this.
info3: This t-shirt design was conceptualized for a school project. In my design, I wanted to focus on making a premium beer as it demonstrates the four GMO-free ingredients being brewed inside the tree looking bottles joined by a treetop. This design shows that during the process of making and getting the beer to the Canadians, there has been a great effort made to keep the environment clean as much as possible. In the center of the image comes out the quality beer. Preserving our environment is very important to me as it is to many Canadians and people around the world.
