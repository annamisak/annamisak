meta: Description of the portfolio piece will be needed to be added here to match the current page content.
info: This illustration originally created for a t-shirt design and since I already have one in my portfolio, I decided it looked super cute as a mug.
info2: The purpose of this cute little Halloween monster design was to solely work in Illustrator, the use of colour separations, and grasp the technic of trapping and over-printing. The imagery is fun and targets a younger audience. The colours were chosen the blend in with a Halloween theme and feel.
