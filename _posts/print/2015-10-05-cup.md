meta: Description of the portfolio piece will be needed to be added here to match the current page content.
info: Originally intended for a t-shirt design, I thought this illustration would look adorable on a mug because I already have one in my portfolio.
info2: This cute little Halloween monster design served as a test project for using Illustrator only, learning how to use color separations, and practicing trapping and overprinting. A younger audience is the target of the playful imagery. The colours were selected to complement the Halloween atmosphere and theme.
